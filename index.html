                    <p> - Augusta Ada Byron was born to English poet, Lord Byron and his wife, Baroness Anne Isabella Milbanke, on December 10, 1815, in London, England.</p>

                    <p> - When Ada was only a month old, her parents separated and the young girl never met her father again. </p>

                    <p> - The young girl had a very strict, religious upbringing, forming a close bond with her grandmother, Judith, rather than her own mother, Anne. Anne did not care much about her own daughter, even calling little
                      Ada 'it', and all correspondence with her own mother was to put up a facade of maternal love.</p>

                    <p> -The child was quite frail, and was bedridden for two years after suffering from measles in 1829.</p>

                    <p> - It was only after two years, that she was able to move around using crutches.
                      However, she was a bright student, with a deep interest in mathematics and science.</p>

                    <p> - Her imaginative mind was curbed by her mother, who made sure that she did not grow an affinity towards poetry, like her father. According to Anne and her friends, poets always turned out to be immoral.
                      The young girl was taught by mathematical geniuses like Mary Somerville, Augustus De Morgan, William King and William Frend.

              <h3>Career</h3>
                <p> - In 1833, Lovelace was introduced to Charles Babbage, also known as the
                  "Father of Computers", by her tutor, Mary Somerville. Since then a professional friendship between the
                  young woman and Babbage ensued, and Ada became interested in the latter's 'Difference Engine. </p>

                <p> - She also became engrossed in phrenology, which dealt with measuring the human skull, and animal magnetism. </p>

                <p> - In the year 1840, Babbage's lecture on his invention, the 'Analytical Engine', delivered at the 'University of Turin', was written in French by Italian, Luigi Menabrea. This paper was printed two years later, in the 'Bibliothèque universelle de Genève'. </p>

                <p> - After the publication, Lovelace took it upon herself to translate Luigi's French
                  paper into English, after a request from Babbage's acquaintance,
                  Charles Wheatstone. The paper was transcribed during 1842-43, and as an addition, the young lady included notes of her own analysis.</p>

                <p> - Her notes spoke about how the 'Analytical Engine' was more advanced than previous machines that were built for the purpose of calculations. She claimed that Babbage's machine could do more than just numerical computations, and went on to explain its operations in detail.</p>
                <div class="engine-pic ">
                  <img class="engine photos-div"  alt="Engine" src="http://ds-wordpress.haverford.edu/bitbybit/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Chapter_2-60.jpg">

                </div>
                <p> - In her notes, which have been marked from A to G, the last contains an algorithm
                  to make Babbage's machine calculate 'Bernoulli numbers'. For writing the first ever
                  algorithm, Ada is hailed as the pioneer of computer programming.</p>

                <p> - During this time, Ada also explained the shortcomings in the 'Analytical Engine',
                    and is now considered as a predecessor of debuggers.</p>

                <p> - In 1844, she ventured on to design a model that would use mathematics
                    to decode the neurological process involved behind the evolution of feelings,
                     calling this "a calculus of the nervous system".</p>

                <p> - Her inspiration came from the fact that her mother always suggested
                     that Ada was probably insane. She met Andrew Crosse, an engineer,
                     in order to find out how she could use electrical experimentation to devise her model.
                      Her plan wasn't successful, and the model never saw the light of the day. </p>

                <p> - In 1844, Lovelace also went on to review a research publication on
                     Animal Magnetism, written by Baron Karl von Reichenbach,
                      but her work was never published.</p>

                <p> Ada Lovelace died of cancer at 36, a few short years after the
                    publication of “Sketch of the Analytical Engine, with Notes from the Translator”.
                </p>
                <p>The Analytical Engine remained a vision, until Lovelace’s notes became one of the critical
                  documents to inspire Alan Turing’s work on the first modern computers in the 1940s.
                </p>
                <p>Her thwarted potential, and her passion and vision for technology, have made her a powerful
                  symbol for modern women in technology.
